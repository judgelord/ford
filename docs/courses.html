<p>Graduate 3</p>
<p>The primary objective of this core course in the MPP curriculum is to equip students with the knowledge and skills needed for effective political analysis of public policy issues and decisions. The course covers conceptual and analytic frameworks for understanding political processes, institutions, interested parties, contexts and policy decision-making. In addition, the course builds written and verbal communication skills, emphasizing the ability to convey clear and concise political analyses in a variety of formats, including policy memos.</p>
<p>In this section of 510, students will analyze the politics that affect foreign policy choices related to international security, broadly defined. We will consider multiple perspectives about the nature of the international system and how this system pushes actors to war or facilitates cooperation. We will investigate several critical topics related to international security, including great power competition, interstate and civil war, post-conflict reconstruction, technology, and climate change. Overall, the course aims to: 1) ground students with the theoretical knowledge to understand global challenges to cooperation; 2) identify and anticipate significant sources of conflict; 3) deepen students’ knowledge of contemporary global security issues; 4) challenge assumptions about global politics and think critically about contemporary security issues from multiple perspectives; 5) encourage creativity and collective problem-solving about international security problems and 6) improve students’ written and verbal communication.</p>

<p>This section of 510 focuses on the politics of policymaking in the U.S. federal system, with special emphasis on environmental policy. Students will learn how policy agendas are shaped and enacted within and across institutions of local, state, and U.S. federal government, as well as Native nations. We will study the roles of different actors, types of authority, and advocacy strategies and develop skills required to inform and influence policy. We will apply this conceptual understanding to policy challenges related to renewable energy siting in Michigan, which we will use as working examples throughout the semester.</p>

<p>How do the judges on the Supreme Court make their decisions? What were the real issues in cases such as Roe v. Wade, and how did the Court come to overturn this decision? How do judges in different eras decide cases differently? The Supreme Court is a unique contributor to public policy in the United States, and as such is a frequent topic of academic and media discussion and analysis. While you may be familiar with political or media interpretations of cases, you may not be familiar with legal arguments and the methods used by the Court in making decisions.</p>
<p>In this course, we will explore some of the most influential Supreme Court cases, and how they came to be decided. For each case, in addition to understanding the reasoning of the Court, we will understand the background, the political or social context of the case, the legal arguments involved, how select subsequent cases have interpreted it, and how the case influenced public policy. In the process of these discussions, you will develop skills in reading and understanding cases, legal research, logical argument and understanding legal and policy implications of Supreme Court decisions.</p>
<p>The main writing assignment for this class will be a research paper in which you undertake legal and policy analysis of a particular line of Court decisions.</p>

<p>Experts increasingly see the slow policy response to climate change as having less to do with climate science and more to do with politics. This class explores different forms of politics (different ways of having and resolving debates about who our community is and what we will do together about the challenges we face) and their implications for policy. The readings mostly draw on political science, political theory, and law. We will also read op-eds and reports from advocates and journalists covering policy debates.</p>
<p>This reading- and writing-intensive seminar focuses on persuasive writing for a public audience and constructive criticism. The aim is to help you develop your own critique of various policy debates over what to do about our new relationship with our biosphere and communicate your ideas clearly.</p>

<p>Undergraduate 4</p>
<p>PUBPOL 495 (Policy Seminar) is for students currently enrolled in the Public Policy Undergraduate Program only, no exceptions. Enrollment is by permission only.</p>
<p>When designing new policies or programs, or adapting existing policies at the local level, engaging the public can enable governments to be more targeted to local needs, more effective within a local context, and more sustainable by developing local ownership and buy-in, among other benefits. The practice of public participation seeks to engage the public in decision-making about policies and programs that affect them, or about which they have a special interest. This course will explore the strategies commonly used to engage the intended targets of a policy in policy-making and programmatic design both at the domestic and international levels. Topics include the ‘why’ and ‘when’ of participation within the policy process, design of participation activities, tools for engagement of participants, analyzing and using public insight, as well as key challenges of public participation such as ensuring representativeness, equity, and inclusion within participation activities. Students will delve into ethical issues inherent in balancing ‘how much’, ‘when’, and ‘whose’ participation is sought within a given context.</p>
<p>Students will engage in theoretical and case-based work, and will practice designing, implementing, and analyzing outcomes from participation activities. To do this, students will work in teams of 3-4 to lead participation activities in a simulated environment. Students will also be expected to hone their policy writing skills through written reflections and by developing a public participation design and results memo. The memo will be drafted in sections throughout the semester, after which students will revise each section based on feedback for inclusion in the final memo.</p>

<p>The combination of slow economic growth and rising inequality has meant that the material living standards of the median American household have improved only slowly since the early 1970s. Similar economic stagnation has afflicted many other developed economies. These economic conditions are arguably in large part responsible for growing political polarization and the rise of populist movements.</p>
<p>This course will place these recent trends in context by studying the 20th century economic history of the U.S., Europe, and Japan. We will examine (1) the origins of modern economic growth in the 19th century and the forces that increased growth in the 20th century; (2) the tremendous economic disruption of the Great Depression; (3) the growth success of the 1950s and 1960s; and (4) the cyclical and structural economic problems faced by the U.S., Europe, and Japan since 1973. The focus of this course will be on the economics of these events and the responses of economic policymakers. But we will also look to history and political science for alternative perspectives.</p>
<p>In addition to short writing assignments, students will write two five page papers.</p>

<p>What are public official apologies? How are official public apologies related to the complex politics of difficult social questions of national democratic membership, memory and constitution? How national dialogues on reparations are mediated and publicly articulated over time shapes not only nation state but also how members, groups and citizens see themselves in relation to each other. How do individuals, communities, nations and states mediate, acknowledge, remember, deny or ignore their violent national pasts and conflicts? What has been the role of transitional justice mechanisms such as truth commissions and acts of official public apology in shaping reparative frameworks as part of the democratic state’s quest for greater social cohesion after conflict? Why is it important to understand how the intersecting structural relations and imbalances of power, domination and subordination inherent to conflict dynamics can be addressed through national public policy and reparative frameworks? What are the historical, social, economic and policy challenges faced by states after extended periods of administrative violence and internal conflicts. How do the politics inherent to collective, institutional, group and collective interests strategically influence the ways in which the policy frameworks and corresponding social, political and economic outcomes are resolved politically? These national membership questions remain a constant part of the legal, political, moral, historical and national dialogue constituting the current national public policy frameworks which in turn affect important questions and conflicts on reparative, social, administrative justice and the meaning of human rights. To address these questions this comparative public policy seminar will explore the currency and economics of transitional justice mechanisms, reparative processes and public official apologies in South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the USA.</p>

<p>Undergraduate 3</p>
<p>Researchers, policymakers, and publics look to science and technology to address some of society’s most pressing challenges, from climate change to national security to economic growth. But such efforts are also controversial. Think of fears that automation will create mass unemployment, that biotechnology threatens human health and natural biodiversity, or that the regulation of toxins in the environment is either insufficient or overzealous. This course examines the competing values that shape debates over how and when science and technology provide appropriate solutions to social problems, as well as how and when we should look to technical expertise to settle political and values-based disputes.</p>
<p>Its goals are 1) to equip you with the interdisciplinary skills necessary to advocate for socially responsible science and technology policy; and 2) to provide concepts and tools for reasoning and writing about the normative challenges that shape a variety of policy challenges, within and beyond science and technology.</p>
<p>Background in the sciences, technology, and ethics are not required for the course.</p>

<p>“What are the values and ethics of foreign policy? Foreign policy refers to interactions between states, yet states are built by and use violence. States also create and reinforce social inequalities. Therefore, the state-to-state interactions that typify foreign policy often have implications for both violence and social inequalities. This course will rely upon a multidisciplinary body of literature from political science, history, sociology, psychology, and economics as a theoretical base for in-class discussion, then interrogate real examples of foreign policies from both the U.S. and around the world that have implications for political violence–civil war, mass repression, interstate war, rebellion–and enduring social inequities. Students will consider the ethical and practical implications of the works reviewed for real-world foreign policy debates.”</p>

It will then turn to the fundamentals of climate change, with a basic overview of the science, the economic principles that can guide policymaking to reduce emissions, and key social dynamics that shape policies and markets. We will then turn to the real-world application of public policies at the international and national level, developing an understanding of how these policies are designed along with their effectiveness.</p>
<p>The course will conclude with a series of case studies on potential approaches to addressing the interconnected spheres of energy and climate. Case studies will focus on the sometimes difficult trade-offs that arise in trying to prevent the worst impacts of climate change while provide the energy that underpins the global economy. We will examine the political, economic, technological, and psychological aspects of pursuing alternative approaches to achieve these interconnected goals.</p>

<p>Topics: Africa In Context: Diplomacy, Democracy, and Development</p>
<p>Africa is the continent least understood by Americans; it is often presented by the media as a land of war, famine, drought, and poverty. This course will present Africa’s contemporary reality, the positive as well as the negative by examining major current issues after briefly surveying Africa’s history, geography, societies and culture. Themes covered will include: political developments; regional conflicts; human rights and fundamental freedoms; economic development (including the role played by international assistance); humanitarian crises and intervention; terrorism; population growth and urbanization; and public health crises (including Ebola and Covid-19). The course will focus on providing students with an in-depth understanding of the historical, as well as contemporary context to policy-making in Africa and provide them with an opportunity to analyze the successes and failures of policy implementation.</p>

<p>Graduate 1.5</p>
<p>Conflict is an evitable part of the human experience–in relationships, at the work place, in public administration and especially in the public policy making process. Unresolved conflict can hinder decision making and impede organization change, but when conflict is addressed, managed or transformed, it is possible for relationships, organizations, and systems to grow and succeed. Drawing on empirical research and case studies, this skills-based course will begin with a discussion of the impact of conflict in systems and a taxonomy of forms of conflict with an eye toward public administration. Then the course will focus on the development of strategies that can be used to resolve or manage conflicts, with opportunities for students to develop those skills through in-class exercises. Special attention will be paid to skills that can be used to address conflicts that emerge across differences such as race and ethnicity, political orientation, and gender.</p>

<p>Graduate 3</p>
<p>This is a basic, foundational course for master’s students interested in the actual work of human rights. The idea that a respect for human dignity and universal equality should constrain the actions of governments has influenced political activity for centuries, but it was not until very recently that global movements sought to and succeeded in codifying the principles of human rights in documents that could be enforced internationally. The emergence and rapid evolution of international human rights frameworks over the last 80 years has been profound. An important purpose of this course is to assist students in understanding the origins, context, applications, and ongoing growth of and threats to international human rights principles and doctrines in both international and national politics.</p>
<p>Using primary policy, legal and primary texts as well as disciplinary and transdisciplinary intellectual works, we will examine which rights are considered fundamental, their sources and how the discourse international human rights has grown over time. These documents serve as a basis for an emerging area of international human rights policies that affects both how governments should relate to their populations and how countries relate to one another. We will discuss the roles and strategies of the various actors involved, including grassroots activists, survivor groups, policy professionals, elected officials within the constraints of International Humanitarian Law (IHL), International Human Rights Law (IHRL) and International Relations.</p>
<p>We will explore discourses on human rights, the statist system and state sovereignty, and how the search for peace, equality, justice, freedom and human security has evolved in relation to state and its responsibility to its own people and that of other states. The overall aim of the course is to develop a substantive understanding, to strengthen our policy analysis and to gain a better grounding for analyzing how human rights principles are being created, engaged, operationalized, implemented and threatened. Students will gain a foundational understanding of international human rights law, international human rights law, the evolution of the state and statist responsibility. Students will also have many opportunities to learn about and discuss diverse human rights values, principles, concerns, and responses - internationally.</p>

<p>Great power rivalry is a critical concept that frames current perceptions of international affairs around China’s rise, Russia’s resurgence and the United States relative decline. This undergraduate course goes beyond the traditional focus on the U.S., China, and Russia by providing a comprehensive overview of the shifting dynamics in global power politics of the 21st century. It will explore the involvement of rising powers in the international order, such as India, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, Morocco, Gulf countries and Indonesia. The course will examine each rising power’s foreign policies and strategic priorities, their economic and military capabilities and how these shape how they engage and compete in the global order. The course will also examine how global rivalries play out within multilateral organizations (such as the United Nations, NATO, the European Union and the African Union) and will deep dive into current geopolitical crises such as the war in Ukraine, the political crises of the Sahel and China’s ambitions over Taiwan.</p>

<p>More than 50 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, significant gender and ethno-racial inequality in the labor market remains. Why? This course relies on a multidisciplinary literature from sociology, economics, psychology, and socio-legal studies to examine ethno-racial and gender inequality in the labor market. We will first review and evaluate major explanations of inequality in the labor market, including employer discrimination, human capital differences, sexual harassment, occupational sex segregation, mass incarceration, inflexible workplaces, and segregated social networks. Then, we will discuss public policies and organizational efforts that seek to directly or indirectly ameliorate ethno-racial and/or gender inequality, such as paid family leave, “ban the box,” unconscious bias and sexual harassment trainings, and increases to the minimum wage.</p>
<p>Fabiana Silva Assistant Professor of Public Policy Silva studies the mechanisms that perpetuate (or mitigate) group-based labor market inequality, with a focus on social networks and employer discrimination. She examines how employers reward the referrals of black and white job applicants, the relationship between employers’ racial attitudes and their hiring behavior, and the determinants of how people are racially classified by others. She also investigates how different ways of framing immigration affect attitudes towards immigration policy.

<p>Graduate .5</p>
<p>The goal of this course is to familiarize you with the norms and types of policy writing. While policy writing draws upon principles familiar to academic writing, it has its own conventions, which are rooted in the needs and practices of policy professionals. Through these five intensive classes, we believe you will acquire greater confidence to excel in the policy writing expected of you at the Ford School and in your future career.</p>

<p>Graduate 3</p>
<p>This is a core course restricted to Ford School MPP and MPA students only.</p>
<p>This section of 580 focuses primarily on U.S. policy and politics.</p>
<p>This course seeks to make students sensitive to and articulate about the ways in which moral and political values come into play in the American policy process, particularly as they affect non-elected public officials who work in a world shaped by politics. Topics covered include the tensions between ethics and politics, an introduction to various moral theories that figure in contemporary policy debates, a consideration of the principal values that animate American politics, and issues and dilemmas in professional ethics. The course addresses issues that affect international as well as U.S. policy and politics.</p>

<p>Graduate 3</p>
<p>This is a core course restricted to Ford School students only.</p>
<p>We often think of policy analysis as a technical field in which we apply analytical tools to determine the most effective and efficient way to achieve policy goals. However, every time we enter the policy arena, we confront normative questions with no agreed-upon answers: What is the public good? How do we decide among competing goods? What should our policy goals be and how do we determine them? How do we make decisions when normative commitments and goals are themselves in conflict?</p>
<p>This course is based on the conviction that understanding the moral and ethical dimensions of public policy is necessary to effective policy analysis and a crucial foundation for any policy career. This course will familiarize you with a set of concepts and tools for reasoning, arguing, and writing about the normative issues that confront people working in politics and public policy. Our approach will combine theoretical interrogation of applied ethics with a case-based approach to theoretical applications. We will connect concepts from political philosophy and applied ethics including utility, liberty, justice, and rights to unpack and assess real-world challenges that face policy analysts and policymakers. Our examination will span topics from a variety of policy arenas. This section of 580 focuses primarily on U.S. domestic policy, with some attention to international policy.</p>
<p>Students who take this course will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gain an understanding of key concepts in applied ethics, including the ethics of professional practice</p></li>
<li><p>Develop and demonstrate the ability to think in a sophisticated, reflective, and reflexive manner about the values and goals of public policies in a variety of arenas</p></li>
<li><p>Develop the ability to identify the values implicit in policies, articulate their own values, and engage the values of others</p></li>
<li><p>Develop and demonstrate the ability to communicate concisely and persuasively, both orally and in writing, about the moral and ethical dimensions of politics and public policy</p></li>
<li><p>Develop the ability to integrate ethical considerations into policy analysis and decision-making</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategic-public-policy-consulting">578 Strategic Public Policy Consulting</h2>
<p>Graduate 4</p>
<p>This course will be co-taught with Former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. The Ford School of Public Policy’s Strategic Public Policy Consulting (SPPC) is a semester-long, four-credit course offered to students in the Ford School and other UM professional degree programs. The course provides an opportunity for students to conduct a supervised consulting project. We expect the clients for the course to be a mix of local governments and nonprofit organizations based in Michigan and the Chicagoland area.</p>
<p>Teams of 3-5 students will work with a client representative to develop a project work plan, collect relevant materials and information, and conduct research and analysis. All projects culminate in the production of a final report and an oral presentation to the client. In return, clients are asked to help provide students with a valuable, engaging educational and professional experience. Projects may range widely in policy area, methodology, size, and complexity.</p>
<p>Learning objectives include: ● Gaining hands-on experience by applying policy tools to help an external partner ● Developing leadership skills and meaningful community engagement experiences ● Learning how to organize, plan, and carry-out a long-term group project ● Enhancing writing and oral presentation skills via a final presentation and paper</p>
<p>The lecture portion of class meets on Thursdays from 2-5:20 pm and will be dedicated to a mix of (a) skills-building workshops, (b) thematic panel discussions featuring local government officials, leaders of nonprofit and philanthropic organizations, and professional consultants, and (c) meetings between the instructors and each of the teams.</p>
<p>The discussion section meets on Fridays from 9-9:50 am and will be used for (a) debriefing on workshops and/or panel discussions from lectures, (b) classwide discussion of issues that teams are confronting in their projects, (c) meetings with project team-leads, and (d) team meetings with clients.</p>
<p>There will also be a class trip to Chicago (tentatively scheduled for September 11-12) to meet with government officials, community leaders, and project clients, and take a guided tour of Chicago. Students will receive stipends to cover their travel and lodging expenses.</p>
